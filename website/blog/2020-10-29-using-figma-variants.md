[Variants](https://www.figma.com/blog/bridging-design-and-code-with-variants/) is an amazing new feature of Figma, which lets you combine variations of the same component â€” simplifying the asset panel and mapping components more closely to code.

We were waiting for their launch since the announcement and started the implementation of Variants support in [react-figma](https://github.com/react-figma/react-figma) right after the Figma API [Version 1, Update 18](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/blog/2020/10/28/version-1-update-18/) release. Figma API got several new APIs:

- Type [ComponentSetNode](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/ComponentSetNode/) â€” A component set contains the variants of a component.
- [combineAsVariants](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/figma/#combineasvariants) method â€” Creates a new ComponentSetNode by combining all the nodes in nodes, which should all have type ComponentNode.
- [importComponentSetByKeyAsync](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/figma/#importcomponentsetbykeyasync) method.

# `ComponentSet` component

We added a new component for Figma Variants support: the [`ComponentSet`](https://react-figma.now.sh/docs/api/component#componentset). Itâ€™s accepts a set of `Component` nodes as the `children` prop. We created [an example](https://github.com/react-figma/react-figma/tree/master/examples/component-variants) with a button that has three variants: *primary*, *dangerous*, and *secondary*:

```jsx
<ComponentSet name="Button">
    <Component name="variant=Primary">
        <PrimaryButton text="Primary" />
    </Component>
    <Component name="variant=Dangerous">
        <DangerousButton text="Dangerous" />
    </Component>
    <Component name="variant=Secondary">
        <SecondaryButton text="Secondary" />
    </Component>
</ComponentSet>
```

(see complete code [here](https://github.com/react-figma/react-figma/blob/master/examples/component-variants/src/App.tsx))

You can try the result of the rendering [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/903625837057389198/Component-Variants-%2F-react-figma) or watch a demo gif:

# Conclusion

Variants are a really useful feature, especially for design systems creation. So, enjoy it with [react-figma](https://github.com/react-figma/react-figma) too!

Happy coding! ðŸ™Œ
