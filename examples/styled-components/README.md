# ðŸ’… styled-components example

Cross-platform component library example with `styled-components/primitives`.

(inspired by and code borrowed from: https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp/blob/master/examples/styled-components/src/my-command.js)

## Getting Started

```sh
curl https://codeload.github.com/react-figma/react-figma/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 react-figma/examples/styled-components
cd styled-components
```

[How to run](../../contributing.md#running-examples)

## How It Works

You can use `styled-components/primitives` to build cross-platform UI components that will render to `react-figma`. This is great for building cross-platform UI libraries, that can compile down to a Figma component library for designers to build designs using the same components that are used in production.
