[React Figma](https://react-figma.now.sh/) website has switched to using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) v2.
Docusaurus has many advantages over [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) that used previously:

* Better perfomance
* Working as a single page application
* Customization abilities
* Syntax highlighting through [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/)
* Light/dark theme switching ðŸ˜Ž

Also, Docusaurus developing fast, has awesome community and [users](https://docusaurus.io/en/users).
